# Welcome!

Welcome to **Python Tutorial**!

In this Python tutorial, youâ€™ll be introduced to computer programming by using Python, one of the most beginner-friendly languages. Python is fun to learn, but is also a real programming language that powers websites and apps used by multiple  companies.



## Run your first program!

*(To run the example, just press the Run button and press the clear button to clear the draw)*

<p_c size=M>
from turtle import *
colors = ['red', 'purple', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange']
for x in range(50):
    pencolor(colors[x % 6])
    width(x / 50 + 1)
    forward(x*3)
    left(59)
</p_c>

# Keep Going!

You'll discover many new concept of programing during this tutorial. Code may look confusing, but if you run into an error, just keep trying until you succeed. 

This turtorial consists of many chapters. In each chapter,  you will gain an insight into how Python code works. You can practice what you have learned and take quizzes to test  your knowledge.

During this tutorial, you will be able to develop a game called "The Word Guessing Game". In this game, the program will pick a random secret word out of a list of words and the player will have to try to guess the secret word by guessing each letter at a time.


Let's get started and Have fun!
